# Stylish Login Page with XAMPP Database (PHP + MVC)

This repository contains a stylish login page built using PHP and connected to a XAMPP database. The project follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture to ensure a clean separation of concerns and maintainability. Additionally, it allows users to edit their profiles by uploading files.

## Features

- User-friendly and visually appealing login page.
- Secure password hashing using PHP's `md5()` function.
- User authentication and validation against the XAMPP database.
- MVC architecture for modular code organization.
- Error handling and display of appropriate messages for invalid credentials or server errors.
- Edit user profiles by uploading files.

## Technologies Used

- PHP: The backend scripting language used for server-side logic.
- XAMPP: A popular cross-platform web server solution bundle that includes Apache, MySQL, PHP, and more.
- HTML/CSS: The front-end languages used for creating the login page and styling it.
- MVC Architecture: A software design pattern that separates the application logic into three interconnected components: Model, View, and Controller.
